Project Progress - Fitness App
Over the last two weeks, our team has been making significant progress on the Fitness App. Some key updates include:

Implementing AI-based coaching for workout recommendations.
Enhancing the UI/UX for better user interaction.
Working on database management to store user activity and workout history.
Debugging API key issues related to AI integration, which sometimes resets due to updates or incorrect storage handling.
Challenges & Next Steps
One ongoing issue is that the AI key frequently resets, requiring manual updates. We are working on:

Exploring secure storage methods for API keys to prevent frequent resets.
Automating key renewal with token refresh mechanisms.
Implementing error handling to detect when the AI service is unreachable and prompt for action.
Next, we will focus on:

Completing AI model training for customized workouts.
Integrating real-time analytics to track user progress.
Finalizing mobile app deployment.
